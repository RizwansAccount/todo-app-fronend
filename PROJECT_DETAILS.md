In this project, I used only one library, Tailwind CSS, because it is easy to use and allows for writing concise CSS.
I used fetch to call APIs and created a custom hook that accepts API endpoints and methods for making requests.
I created a separate modal component with its own CSS, and simply passed the content to be displayed inside the modal as children.
